### Excel::Template

Original library in CPAN [Excel::Template](http://search.cpan.org/~rbo/Excel-Template-0.34/)

I'm more than happy to hand over the repository. I needed just a small change,
but there was no github repository to fork and the author seems on hiatus.

ORIGINAL README FOLLOWS
=======================

Excel::Template is a layout system to use the data structure from HTML::Template
and create a Microsoft Excel file.

CAVEAT: All limitations stated in Spreadsheet::WriteExcel are in force, as that
is the module used for rendering. If the XLS file is corrupted, I would first
make sure you aren't doing anything that it says is bad.
